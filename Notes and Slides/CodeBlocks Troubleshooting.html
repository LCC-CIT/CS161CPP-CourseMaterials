<h1>Code::Blocks Troubleshooting Tips</h1>
<p>One of the most common problems that students have had with
<a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks</a> is that after it has been 
first set up it won't run the compiler. There are a number of possible causes:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>There is no compiler installed.</strong><br>
	Code::Blocks is mainly just a user interface. It requires a separtate 
	compiler and C++ libraries to do the actual compiling, linking, and 
	debugging. In the Code::Blocks setup menu this is referred to as a 
	"toolchain". If you already have a compiler and it's associated tools 
	installed on your computer, then you can just install Code::Blocks by itself 
	and it will use the compiler that is already installed. It supports quite a 
	few compilers: Visual Studio C++, GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), 
	MinGW (Minimal GCC for Windows), etc. The setup file for just the Code::Blocks 
	IDE by itself is:
	<a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/codeblocks/codeblocks-10.05-setup.exe">
	codeblocks-10.05-setup.exe</a>. But&nbsp; if you don't already have a compiler 
	instaled on your computer, then you should install Code::Blocks 
	with MinGW. The combined setup file for Code::Blocks and MinGW is:
	<a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/codeblocks/codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe">
	codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe</a>. This is the setup file that will work 
	the best in most situations.<br>
	<span class="style5">Solutions</span><ol class="style1">
		<li>&nbsp;Reinstall Code::Blocks using the setup program that includes 
		MinGW:&nbsp;
		<a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/codeblocks/codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe">
		codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe</a></li>
		<li>Solution b: Leave Code::Blocks installed, but install a 
		compiler/toolchain to work with it. You can download the setup progam for
		<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> here:
		<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">MinGW download page</a>. When you run the MinGW installer, be sure to select 
		the C++ compiler and the MinGW Developer Toolkit in addition to the MinGW base files.<br>
		Important: After installing MinGW, you need to set the toolset path in 
		Code::Blocks to point to your MinGW installation. See the section below 
		for instructions.<br>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>The compiler is installed, but Code::Blocks can't find it.<br>
	</strong><span class="style5">Solutions</span><ol class="style1">
		<li>Use the Code::Blocks auto-detect feature to find the compiler<ol class="style3">
			<li>On the Code::Blocks menu, go to "Settings", next click on 
			"Compiler and Debugger...". This will open the "Compiler and 
			debugger settings dialog".</li>
			<li>Under "Selected compiler" select the name of the compiler you 
			are using. For most of you it will be "GNU GCC Compiler".</li>
			<li>Click on the tab that says "Toolchain executables", then click 
			the button "Auto-detect". This should cause the compiler's 
			installation directory to be automatically inserted into the text 
			box to the left of the button.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<ol class="style1" start="2">
		<li>Manually enter the path to the compiler's installation directory</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<ol class="style1">
		<ol class="style3">
			<li>On the Code::Blocks menu, go to "Settings", next click on 
			"Compiler and Debugger...". This will open the "Compiler and 
			debugger settings dialog".</li>
			<li>Under "Selected compiler" select the name of the compiler you 
			are using. For most of you it will be "GNU GCC Compiler".</li>
			<li>Click on the tab that says "Toolchain executables", then type in 
			the path to the compiler's installation directory in the text box 
			labeld "Compiler's installation directory".</li>
			<li>Be sure the names of all the executables are entered in the 
			spaces listed under "Program Files".</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p class="style4" style="width: 704px;">The screen shot below shows the default 
compiler and debugger settings if you installed Code::Blocks with the setup 
program that includes MinGW. These settings are the same on Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7. 
(I've personally installed and tested Code::Blocks on 32 bit versions of each 
Windows OS and the 64 bit version of Windows 7.)<br>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>You don't have permission to write to the&nbsp; directory 
	(folder) where your source code (.cpp file) is located.<br>
	</strong><span class="style5">Solution</span><strong><br>
	</strong>Save your source file to your Documents folder, or some other 
	location (like the desktop) that you know your user login has permission to 
	write to.</li>
	<li><strong>You created a .c source file instead of a .cpp source file.<br>
	</strong><span class="style5">Solution</span><br>
	Using the "Save as" option from the Code::Blocks file menu, save the source 
	file as a .cpp file.</li>
